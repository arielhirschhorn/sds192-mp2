## Loading the data

This project is so interesting and relevant to my life! This is a change Ariel made as part of the lab

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
load("house_elections.rda")
load("candidates.rda")
load("committees.rda")
load("contributions.rda")
#change1
```

```{r}
incumbents_df <- house_elections %>%
  filter(incumbent == TRUE) %>%
  group_by(ge_winner, party) %>%
  summarize(total = n())
```

```{r}
newcandidates_df <- house_elections %>%
filter(incumbent == FALSE, ge_winner != "") %>%
  group_by(ge_winner) %>%
  if(party != "D" && party != "R")
  {summarize(independent = tally(party))}
   
```
 attempt using case_when

```{r}
newcandidates_df <- house_elections %>%
filter(incumbent == FALSE, ge_winner != "") %>%
  group_by(ge_winner) %>%
  mutate(case_when(
    party != "R" & party != "D" ~ "Ind", TRUE ~ party
  ))
   
```
 
> Word count: `r wordcountaddin::word_count()`


```{r}

```
